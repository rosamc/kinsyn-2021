Repository with the code and experimental data to reproduce the work by Martinez-Corral et al on kinetic synergy.

The work was first reported as a bioRxiv preprint in:
Martinez-Corral R*, Park M*, Biette K*, Friedrich D, Scholes C, Khalil A. S, Gunawardena J, DePace AH. Transcriptional kinetic synergy: a complex landscape revealed by integrating modelling and synthetic biology. bioRxiv 2020.08.31.276261; DOI: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.31.276261

Once it has been peer-reviewed and published in a journal, this file will be updated appropriately.

Please cite accordingly.

Details:

The modelling calculations are performed in C++, executed from Python using pybind. Writing and compiling the code requires:

1. Eigen.
2. GeneRegulatoryFunctions repository: https://github.com/rosamc/GeneRegulatoryFunctions
3. Polynomial solving routines in repository https://github.com/kmnam/polynomials, commit 8c8a8b5c7e57bfb98b3ea5a155039a25c2ecb43.

In addition, functions for analysing results and plotting are in the repository https://github.com/rosamc/scriptssyn.
